# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I plan on adding an iframe with a Spotify playlist. Either in the header section or the about section; maybe the header area. The idea is to add sound as customers view the menu/website :)
